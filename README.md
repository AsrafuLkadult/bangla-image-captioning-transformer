## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Transformer-based image captioning model** for Bangla, combining:
- **ResNet** as a CNN encoder for feature extraction.
- **Transformer** as a decoder for generating captions.

The system generates accurate and contextually relevant Bangla captions for images.
